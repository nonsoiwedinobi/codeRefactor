# Code Refactor

## Description

This project aims to enhance the accessibility of an existing website to ensure it is inclusive and usable by people with disabilities. Accessibility is a fundamental aspect of web development, and it involves making web content perceivable, operable, and understandable for a wide range of users, including those with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive impairments.

## Key Objectives

### Semantic HTML Elements

Throughout the source code, we have prioritized the use of semantic HTML elements. Semantic HTML elements provide meaningful structure and convey the purpose of different parts of the content. This not only improves accessibility but also enhances SEO and makes the code more maintainable.

### Logical Structure

Our HTML elements follow a logical structure that is independent of styling and positioning. This ensures that users who rely on assistive technologies, such as screen readers, can navigate and understand the content effortlessly.

### Accessible Images and Icons

We have added descriptive alt attributes to image and icon elements. Alt text provides a text alternative to visual content, making it accessible to users who cannot see the images. It also improves SEO and helps in context understanding.

### Sequential Headings

The heading elements in our documents follow a sequential order. This sequential structure aids in content comprehension and navigation, especially for screen reader users.

### Descriptive Title Elements

Each page contains a concise and descriptive title element. This not only benefits users by providing context but also enhances search engine indexing and ranking.
